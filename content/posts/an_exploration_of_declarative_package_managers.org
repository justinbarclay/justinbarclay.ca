I put up with a cracked screen in my laptop for nearly half a year. I wanted to send it in to get it repaired, I paid the insurance for it so I didn't have to worry about it, but I also hate resetting up my dev environment. So I just dealt with a fractured screen.

My insurance wasn't going to last forever though and unfortunately every month I waited to replace the screen I inched closer to my insurance running out. At work we use [[https://www.terraform.io/][Terraform]] to have as our way of managing our [[https://www.ibm.com/topics/infrastructure-as-code][infrastructure as code]](IaC) . If you haven't heard of IaC, it's the practice of using a high level configuration language to describe your infrasctructure and how it connects to each other to automate the deployment and updating of your cloud infrastructure. IaC spoiled me. It allowed me to be able to run this configuration code from any machine, mine, a vm, or in a CI/CD pipeline and ensure that what was described in those files was deployed reliably and idempotently.

With this in mind, I spent this last fall and winter looking at [[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] and [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]] for declarative package management solutions. Both of these systems allow you to define a set of configuration files in a programming language, Nix uses [[https://nixos.org/guides/nix-pills/index.html][Nixlang]] which is a custom DSL for describing package configuration and Guix uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][Guile]] which is a scheme. 

So, with the deadline for my insurance on my laptop looming over me, I began searching for similar declarative systems but for targeted at maintaining and updating development machines. What I was looking for was a package manager that allowed me to define every package and library I have installed on my machine and it will take care of managing the installation and version interdependencies of everything. The idea behind this being that I could take this configuration with me to any machine or VM, install the package manager, point it at my package declaration files, and it would take care of setting up everything for me.
